A fun little script inspired by another script, to scrape data from Daraz.pk

It saves the scrapped data in a json file in the scrapped-data folder and also saves the screenshots of each page scrapped in the screenshots folder.

This script uses puppeteer a node.js library.


How to Run?

- clone the repo / download the zipped code and extract it
- install Node.js
- run 'npm install' in the working directory
- add your url in the scrapper.js file or not, there is a sample url already
- run 'npm start'
- voila!
